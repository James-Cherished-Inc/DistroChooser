* Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

### Files Modified:
- [`docs/Changelog.md`](docs/Changelog.md): Added new entry for `.gitignore` creation.
- [`docs/DeveloperGuide.md`](docs/DeveloperGuide.md): Updated project structure to include `.gitignore`.
- [`.gitignore`](.gitignore): New file created.

The `.gitignore` file has been added to the project to ensure that temporary files, build artifacts, environment-specific configurations, and other non-essential files are not committed to the Git repository. This improves repository cleanliness and reduces potential conflicts.
