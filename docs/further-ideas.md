# Now

Add a dedicated section in DeveloperGuide.md explaining the filter logic in detail, including default behaviors and priority handling, to provide clearer context for future engineers and reduce troubleshooting time.

Include code snippets or diagrams in MasterImplementationPlan.md for the filter system to visualize how changes integrate with the overall architecture.

Add alt text visible on hovering the ? icon, displaying the description of the filter, based on data/template.json5

SettingsPanel.css & SettingsPanel.js

Make sure the local storage is not persistent when user clears cache / maybe even when they close the website

# Later On

### active-filters
- make the badges more visible for each user-set filter

### Optimize performance by implementing lazy loading for distro data or caching filter results to handle larger datasets in the future.
