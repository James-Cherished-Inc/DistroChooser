# Cherished Linux Distro Chooser

Welcome to the Cherished Linux Distro Chooser project! This tool is designed to help users find the perfect Linux distribution based on their specific needs and preferences. By providing a comprehensive, interactive table and powerful filtering options, we aim to simplify the often overwhelming process of choosing a Linux distribution.

## Local Quickstart

To get started with the Linux Distro Chooser, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The application is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and does not require any server-side setup to run locally.

1.  Clone the repository 
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Current Features

The current version of the Linux Distro Chooser provides the following features:

*   **Interactive Table:** Displays a list of Linux distributions with various criteria.
*   **Criteria-based Filtering:** Filter distributions based on Non-Negotiable, Important, and Nice-to-Have criteria priorities.
*   **Sorting:** Sort the table by different criteria columns.
*   **Distribution Elimination:** Users can hide distributions from the table that do not meet their requirements.
*   **Detailed Information:** View more detailed specifications and scores for each distribution.

## Planned Features

We are continuously working to improve the Linux Distro Chooser. Planned features include:

*   Export/Import functionality for user preferences and filtered lists.
*   An AI-powered recommendation engine to suggest distributions based on user input.
*   Enhanced accessibility features for a wider range of users.
*   Performance optimizations for handling larger datasets.
*   Integration with external data sources like DistroWatch API for real-time, comprehensive data.

## Vision and Goals

Our vision is to become the go-to resource for anyone looking to choose a Linux distribution. We aim to provide an intuitive, data-driven tool that empowers users to make informed decisions, ultimately contributing to the growth and adoption of Linux.

Key goals include:

*   Building a comprehensive and accurate database of Linux distributions and their characteristics.
*   Developing a robust and flexible filtering and recommendation system.
*   Creating a user-friendly and accessible interface.
*   Fostering a community around the tool for data contributions and feedback.

## How to Use

The interactive table is the core of the Linux Distro Chooser.

1.  **Viewing Distributions:** All available distributions are listed in the table, with columns representing different criteria.
2.  **Filtering:** Use the checkboxes at the top of the page to apply filters based on criteria priorities (Non-Negotiable, Important, Nice-to-Have). Checking a box will hide distributions that do not meet *all* criteria within that priority level.
3.  **Sorting:** Click on the column headers to sort the table based on that criterion's score or value.
4.  **Eliminating Distributions:** Use the "❌ Eliminate" button in the "Actions" column to hide a specific distribution from the table.
5.  **Viewing Details:** Use the "ℹ️ Details" button in the "Actions" column to view a modal with more detailed information about a distribution, including system requirements and detailed scoring.

We hope this tool helps you find the perfect Linux distribution for your needs!
